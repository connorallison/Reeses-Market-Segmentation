In this project I did a market segmentation targeting people who identified themselves as frequent consumers of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.

Step 1: Identify single driver variables, abstract constructor factor variables, and descriptor variables

Step 2: Extract the target and single driver variables variables from the NCS data set 

Step 3: Create and extract a single construct (abstract constructs) from multiple variables

Step 4: Run PCA analysis. I decided to use the PCA extraction technique because I am performing exploratory analysis on my data and trying to form constructs. 
Additionally, PCA has the advantage that the correlation of factors in the analysis corresponds to the correlation of factor scores produced.
I used varimax rotation because I wanted the clusters to be independent. 
The criterion for determining a factor is extracted is that the factor must have an Eigenvalue of 1 or greater. 
The goal is to have our two factors account for at least 50% of the variance. 

Step 5: Cluster market segments using k means clustering

Step 6: Cluster market segments using GAP analysis

Step 7: Interpret descriptor variable cluster means across clusters. 

Findings: Cluster 1 is comprised of the people who scored highest on the weekly_exercise and legalize_pot measures. These people also scored very high on the care_w_money measure. Overall, these folks are very active, financially savvy, not too indulgent or overly concerned with self-care and strongly believe that pot should be legal. Interestingly, cluster 3 includes people with a lot of similarities to those in cluster 1. Cluster three includes people who are the most concerned with selfcare and careful with their money. They are also the least indulgent. The main difference is that these people strongly believe that pot should not be legalized. Cluster 2 is quite different. It is made of people who are the least active and not concerned with selfcare or as careful with their money. They are the most indulgent and do not have strong options on the legalization of pot. 

Compared to the other clusters, Cluster 2 people are the indulgent candy connoisseurs. They are more likely to identify as black than other groups and are least likely to be white or Asian. Many of them enjoy watching Netflix. Interestingly, this group is least likely to respond to any form of advertising at the grocery store.
Cluster 1 people are the average Joeâ€™s. Sure, they enjoy candy but not as much as our candy connoisseurs. They are comprised of people from all different ethnic backgrounds. Many of them can be persuaded to buy candy from floor displays that contain the product and they are very into streaming movies and TV. 
Cluster 3 people are the Careful Consumers. They are not so big on candy or streaming movies and TV. Additionally, they are more likely white, Asian or Hispanic females. Although careful with their money, they are more likely to respond to advertisements than our more indulgent candy connoisseurs. Maybe they just need that extra little push to treat themselves.
