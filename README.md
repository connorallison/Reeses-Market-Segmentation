In this project I did a market segmentation targeting people who identified themselves as frequent consumers of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.

Step 1: Identify single driver variables, abstract constructor factor variables, and descriptor variables

Step 2: Extract the target and single driver variables variables from the NCS data set 

Step 3: Create and extract a single construct (abstract constructs) from multiple variables

Step 4: Run PCA analysis. I decided to use the PCA extraction technique because I am performing exploratory analysis on my data and trying to form constructs. 
Additionally, PCA has the advantage that the correlation of factors in the analysis corresponds to the correlation of factor scores produced.
I used varimax rotation because I wanted the clusters to be independent. 
The criterion for determining a factor is extracted is that the factor must have an Eigenvalue of 1 or greater. 
The goal is to have our two factors account for at least 50% of the variance. 

Step 5: Cluster market segments using k means clustering.
